California Housing Price Prediction: End-to-End Machine Learning PipelineThis repository contains an end-to-end Machine Learning project to predict the median house value for districts in California. We have successfully benchmarked and tuned advanced regression models, concluding with the optimal XGBoost Regressor.🏆 Final Model Performance: XGBoost RegressorThe final model, an optimized XGBoost Regressor, demonstrated superior performance and significantly reduced the prediction error compared to the initial Random Forest model ($\text{RMSE}: \$50,435$).MetricValueInterpretationTest Set RMSE$45,213.82The average prediction error (in USD) is below $\$45,214$.Test Set $\text{R}^2$ Score0.8431The model explains 84.31% of the variance in housing prices, a significant improvement.🧠 Key Findings: Feature Importance & InsightThe XGBoost model reveals a critical insight: Geographic Location (specifically being Inland) is the primary driver of housing prices, even more so than income.RankFeatureImportance ScoreInsight1ocean_proximity_INLAND0.4633CRITICAL FINDING: Being far from the coast (INLAND) accounts for nearly half of the model's predictive power, acting as the strongest negative influence on price.2median_income0.2568Household income remains the second most important factor.3population_per_household0.0678Our engineered density feature remains highly influential, suggesting crowding is a key factor.4ocean_proximity_NEAR OCEAN0.0355Living very close to the ocean significantly raises the median value.5ocean_proximity_NEAR BAY0.0280Proximity to a major metropolitan bay area (San Francisco) is also a strong positive factor.📈 Business RecommendationsBased on the highly interpretable XGBoost model, the following actionable recommendations can be made to an investment firm or lending institution:Primary Filter: Location over Income: The model is emphatic: avoid Inland properties for high-value returns. A property in a lower-income coastal region ( <1H OCEAN, NEAR OCEAN, NEAR BAY) is likely to have a higher floor price than a high-income property located deep Inland. Investment portfolios should prioritize districts based on ocean_proximity first.Target High-Density, Coastal Growth: The combination of positive coastal factors and the importance of population_per_household suggests that the strongest investment opportunities lie in coastal districts with favorable (but not crowded) ratios of people to households, as these areas tend to appreciate faster.Lending Risk Assessment: Lending institutions should heavily weight the ocean_proximity_INLAND feature, as it indicates a significantly higher risk profile for a high median house value prediction.🛠️ Methodology HighlightsThe solution leverages a flexible Scikit-learn pipeline, ensuring robust and consistent data transformation:Stratified Sampling: Data was split based on income categories to ensure representative training and test sets.Model Benchmarking: Confirmed XGBoost Regressor as the champion model ($\text{RMSE}: \$46,958.70$ initial).Hyperparameter Tuning: Used GridSearchCV to optimize XGBoost, achieving the final $\text{RMSE}$ of $\$45,213.82$.Refer to the 02_advanced_modeling.ipynb notebook for the full analysis, pipeline code, and residual plot diagnostics.
